Validity of the Different Codes
===============================

.. warning::

    This section is under construction.

    This section will describe the domain of validity of the various codes:

    - Various approximations made (e.g., RZ, quasistatic, etc.)
    - Which physics is captured (e.g., ion motion? hosing? Coulomb scattering? betatron losses? self-injection?)

    This section is in-progress.
